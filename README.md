# GNSS-INS-LC: GNSS and Inertial Navigation System with Loose Coupling

A state-of-the-art implementation of a GNSS and Inertial Navigation System (INS) with Loose Coupling for high-precision navigation.

## Overview

The GNSS-INS-LC project integrates Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) technologies to provide a robust and accurate navigation solution. The loose coupling approach allows for flexibility in the integration process, enhancing the system's performance in various environments.

## Key Features

- **High Precision**: Achieves high-accuracy positioning through the combination of GNSS and INS.
- **Loose Coupling**: Offers a flexible integration approach that is less sensitive to individual sensor errors.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted to various platforms and applications.
- **Open Source**: Encourages community contributions and improvements.
